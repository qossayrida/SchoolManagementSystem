# School Class Information Management System

This program is designed to help school secretaries maintain information for school classes. It utilizes a Binary Search Tree data structure to manage student records. Each student entry includes a unique student ID, student name, home address (city), ID of the class they are currently in, and date of enrollment.

## Features

1. **Insert Student:** Add a new student along with all associated data.
2. **Find Student:** Search for a student by their student ID. Supports updating of student information if found.
3. **List Students by Name:** Display all students in lexicographic order of their names.
4. **Search Students by City:** Find students from a specific city and list them in lexicographic order of their names.
5. **List Students by Class:** Show all students sorted by their class in lexicographic order of their names.
6. **Delete Student:** Remove a student entry by providing their student ID.
7. **Save Data:** Save all student records to a file named `students.data`.
8. **Exit:** Quit the program.

If the file `students.data` exists, the program automatically loads its contents upon startup.
The program operates interactively, providing a menu for users to navigate and perform various operations on the student records.
